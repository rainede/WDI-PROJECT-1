# PROJECT 1: MathFactor<br> _A whack-a-mole type game_

#####
Random holes, random time, click the mole, get points.
10 seconds for game.

check if trusted or cheating through javascript
Need to keep scores, 2 player game, to say who wins.  Use mod 2 to show whose turn it is, swap between players..

Function for generating the interval between pop ups.
Function for generating the random hole, requires list of holes in array, select index at random, and then show mole.  make sure you store which whole currently shown as 2 random pop ups in sequence wouldnâ€™t show up

On objects consider using console.table() to show it

.classList.add vanilla javascript
.class.add jQuery


To make the moles pop up Use a class for the popup to the hole? Or mole? Need to check
Set top to 0 so it moves to the top

Only works if on the mole cell
You have top: 100%
make sure you add a transition and a time

Do a recursive function to add and remove the mole, until the time runs out

Making it interesting - change the cursor to a hammer
Pop up a sound i.e. music bar
Pop up words in a theme - can use jQuery .json
